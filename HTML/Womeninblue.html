        <p>The chase against Australia and now the title triumph. Two of Indian cricket's greatest nights back to back.
            And you can see how much it means to everyone, be it the many former players who are in attendance, the fans
            at the venue, and the players themselves. They know the sacrifices that have been made to get here. There
            are no differences today, only pure joy. And on that note, it's time for us to say goodbye. Was a delight
            bringing you all the action from an incredible tournament. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of
            Siva and Raju Peethala. Good night!
            Oh what a privilege to have witnessed this. A maiden World Cup triumph for Indian women, and it belongs not
            just to Harmanpreet and her phenomenal team, but also to all those who paved the way, and all those who will
            be inspired to pick up a bat and a ball. "We were waiting for this moment, now this moment has come. Now
            want to make it a habit," says Harmanpreet before going on to collect the trophy from ICC Chairman Jay Shah.
            The celebrations begin and Pratika Rawal is there too, on a wheelchair. Fireworks, confetti, roars, cheers,
            tears... The Indian flag is being waved as the players now embark on a victory lap. On the way they meet
            Mithali Raj, Anjum Chopra, Jhulan Goswami and Reema Malhotra, and hand the trophy to them. What lovely
            scenes. Goswami is in tears as she lifts the trophy. The players now proceed on their victory lap with AR
            Rahman's rendition of "Maa Tujhe Salaam" reverberating around the ground.</p>
